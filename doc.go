// Package dragon contains the core APIs for instantiating a DRAGON node.
//
// DRAGON stands for Decentralized Routing Across Geographic Overlay Network.
// It is a peer-to-peer network built with the [HyParView] framework,
// with variations that encourage the network to naturally cluster
// where multiple nodes are present in nearby geography.
//
// See the README for a more detailed specification.
